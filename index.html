            <p>Hi, I am Opatras.</p>
		    <p>I am trying to learn to be creative.</p>
			<p>Likewise, I'm being creative to learn.</p>
			<p>This is my first baby step towards something I have been wanting to try out.</p>
			<p>I will elaborate further eventually.</p>

			        <p>I am currently learning Unity in order to understand how to create real-time applications and design things to work how I would like them to. As a developer, I hope that eventually I will be knowledgable and experienced enough to be able to deliver software which will help myself and those who find benefit from that which I create.</p>
			    	<p>There are other things which I hope to learn, however I will try to develop one step or stage at a time.</p>

				<p>The persona of Opatras is a separation from my alternate reality where I feel too shy to explore any potential which I have dormant within me.</p>
